# stacker

Stacker is a desktop application with the sole purpose of create and display *Enqueuer*'s executions in a graphical way.

Given that, Stacker and Enqueuer have to exchange information, Stacker:
- creates, saves and loads runnables;
- sends them to Enqueuer;
- receives back these runnables' reports;
- parses these reports; and
- displays them.
